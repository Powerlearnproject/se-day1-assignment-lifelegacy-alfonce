Software Engineering Day 1 Assignment

Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

What is Software Engineering?this is the designing, developing, testing, deploying and maintaining software.

The Birth of Software Engineering (1968)

Event: NATO Software Engineering Conference

Impact: It established software development as an engineering discipline, emphasizing structured methodologies, project management, and quality assurance.

The Rise of the Waterfall Model (1970s)

Event: Winston Royce introduces the Waterfall Model

The Emergence of Agile Development (2001)

Event: The Agile Manifesto

Phases of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)

Comparing Waterfall and Agile Methodologies
Aspect

Waterfall

Agile

Approach

Sequential, linear phases (one phase must finish before the next begins).

Iterative and incremental, with continuous cycles of development and feedback.

Flexibility

Rigid and difficult to change requirements once the project starts.

Highly flexible, allowing for changes and new features to be added mid-project.

Customer Involvement

Minimal — the customer is involved mainly at the beginning and end.

High — customers are regularly involved, providing feedback throughout development.

Delivery

The product is delivered as a single, complete release.

The product is delivered in smaller, workable increments (sprints or iterations).

Documentation

Heavy documentation upfront (e.g., requirement specs, design docs).

Lighter documentation, focusing more on collaboration and working software.

Testing

Testing happens after development is complete.

Testing happens continuously throughout the development cycle.

Team Dynamics
Teams work in silos, with distinct handoffs between roles (e.g., dev to test).
Cross-functional teams work closely together, often holding daily stand-ups.
Quality Assurance (QA) Engineer:


Project Manager (PM)
The planner and coordinator who keeps the project on track.
Project planning, resource management, communication, risk management, and progress monitoring.

The Importance of IDEs and VCS in Software Development

Integrated Development Environments (IDEs)

Visual Studio Code, IntelliJ IDEA, PyCharm
Version Control Systems (VCS)
Git, Subversion (SVN)

Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering

What is Prompt Engineering?

Prompt engineering is the practice of crafting and refining the input given to an AI model (like ChatGPT) to guide its responses in the most useful and accurate way possible. It involves designing prompts strategically to generate the desired output.
